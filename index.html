      <p class="pad-left-s pad-right-s text-small">You know that kid who never stopped moving? The one who performed at every goddamn talent show?<br /><br />That was me 😜<br /><br />I've danced on and off my whole life, but it wasn't until I discovered pole dance, that my passion became a need. Every time I left the studio, my brain would be buzzing with choreography ideas. I found it hard to get back to "real life" afterwards, and you won't believe the amount of time I've spent on YouTube watching the pros and screaming, "How did she do that?!?!" 🙌<br /><br />Pole is such a fun challenge! The first time you attempt a trick, it seems impossible. You don't have the core-strength, your back doesn't bend that way, or it just hurts too much to grip with that part of your body... You keep trying though, practicing your own half-ass version of it until one day, you jump on the pole and fucking nail it. There is no high like it. One day you also look in the mirror and realize there's new muscles on your body. Somehow while you were having all that fun, you got strong 💪<br /><br />I need more of this. I must pole dance all of the time. Everyone must know the joy of this fabulous exercise!<br /><br />When I moved back to Chiang Mai, I couldn't find the right place to practice and challenge myself to take it to the next level.  So I decided I needed to open my own studio 😄<br /><br />I've started offering a handful of classes in a pop-up space, and hope to scale up to a dedicated studio by the end of the year. I'm no expert (I practice at about level 3/4) but I'd love to introduce you to the joys of pole, and if you're a hard-core pole dancer who finds yourself in Chiang Mai - I want you to have a place to practice. Teach pole? Awesome, let's figure out how to team up!<br />I'm so excited to get started, and I hope you are too.
