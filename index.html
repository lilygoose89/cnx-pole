  <h2 class="text-center">About Us</h2>
    <p class="">
      Welcome to CNX Pole, Chiang Mai's first dedicated pole dance and fitness school! When Vikky and I first met we were both shocked that a city as diverse and active as Chiang Mai didn't already have a pole studio. We realized we were both determined to bring this art we loved so much to our community so we banded together to do it and we haven't looked back!<br /><br />
      We both separately got hooked on pole after years of dancing in other forms. The physical challenge and endless chase to nail that badass new move is both motivating and highly addictive. While pole is an excellent workout and an expressive dance form, what we also fell in love with was the inclusive, body-positive and accepting nature of the pole community. It has taught us that every body is a pole body and the joy of self-expression through movement.<br /><br />
      For the past year we have been teaching beginner and intermediate pole dance classes and slowly growing our community. First teaching out of a borrowed space in a friend's hostel (#bootstrapping), for a brief time at Fitness Thailand, and now at an amazing new space at Vivid Dance Studios where we offer classes five days a week.<br /><br />
      Our ambition for the next year is to expand our classes to new studios/gyms and to (fingers crossed) maybe even move into our own dedicated space in 2020.<br /><br />
      We hope you will join us on our journey and become as hopelessly addicted to pole as we are!
